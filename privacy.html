    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Dial It Up</strong> (the "App") handles your information. Because the App is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that runs via GitHub Pages, we want to be transparent about how it works.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Dial It Up does not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong> We do not have access to your name, email address, phone number, or precise location. There is no account registration required to play the game.</p>

    <h2>2. Cookies and Web Storage</h2>
    <p>The App may use local browser storage (standard for PWAs) to remember your high scores or game settings locally on your device. This data never leaves your phone and is not sent to us.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The game code is hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. When you open the App, your device connects to GitHub servers to download the game files. GitHub may collect standard web logs (like your IP address) as part of their hosting service, but we do not have access to that data for tracking purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App does not collect any information from children. It is safe for all ages.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the GitHub repository or your provided contact email.</p>
